## Crowdfinding Contract

This is a basic crowdfinding contract created for testing features of Solidity. While it works, it is not intended for production use. Below are the setup instructions and some suggestions for improvement:

### Setup

1. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
2. Compile the contract using Truffle by running `truffle compile`.
3. Run unit tests with `truffle test`.

### Important Note

This contract is intended for educational and testing purposes. It may not have all the necessary security features for production use. If you plan to use it in a production environment, consider implementing additional security measures and thoroughly testing it.

### Contribution

Feel free to contribute by writing more unit tests or improving different sections of the code. Your contributions can help make this contract more robust and suitable for real-world use.
